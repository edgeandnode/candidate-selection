# candidate-selection

Utilities for picking candidates out of a set based on the [weighted product model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_product_model) over criteria such as success rate, latency, etc.

This library is heavily influenced by, and intended to replace, the original indexer selection algorithm used by the Graph Gateway. The original algorithm was designed by Zachary Burns & Theodore Butler.
